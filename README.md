Shellcode
---

This repo holds a bunch of shellcode I've worked on, as well as a few utilities I wrote to help me develop the shellcode. The python script opcodes.py takes assembly written in nasm format and spits out shellcode in various formats that make it easy to use in exploits or in further development. The shellcage program is a simple C harness that lets you test shellcode before using it.
